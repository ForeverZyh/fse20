Reusable Badge

## Reasons

We maintain our tool DEBAR at https://github.com/ForeverZyh/DEBAR, where we 

1. Share the link for downloading the collected datasets.
2. Provide two ways for building and running DEBAR (docker and virtualenv). Please see https://github.com/ForeverZyh/DEBAR/blob/without-SMT/README.md. We provide the docker way of running DEBAR in the review of Reusable Badge.
3. Very detailed documentations of all source files, all classes, and most of the member functions. Please see https://github.com/ForeverZyh/DEBAR/tree/without-SMT/docs.
4. Provide guidelines for contributing and redevelopment of DEBAR. Please see https://github.com/ForeverZyh/DEBAR/blob/without-SMT/CONTRIBUTING.md
